PocketMine-MP is a custom server software for the Minecraft: Bedrock family of Minecraft editions (includes Android, iOS, W10 and others).

What features does it have?
===========================
- A powerful plugin API, which allows you to extend and customize your server far more easily and extensively than any competing server implementations, including the official vanilla server.
- Multi-world support, allowing you to offer a more varied game experience to players without transferring them to other server nodes.
- Performance fit to hold 100+ players (depends on hardware, see the :ref:`requirements` section).
- Continuously updated to support latest Minecraft versions. PocketMine-MP has the longest and best track record of any custom server for compatibility with new Minecraft versions.

.. note::

   PocketMine-MP is **NOT** a complete vanilla server, and it doesn't have some features you would find in the vanilla game.

   If you just want to play *survival multiplayer* and don't care about *plugins*, you should consider using the `official Minecraft: Bedrock server software <https://minecraft.net/download/server/bedrock>`_ instead of using PocketMine-MP.
